        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; max-width: 800px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
            POSITION was born from a simple observation: real status doesn't need a logo. It's felt, not shown.
        </p>

        <div style="margin: 80px 0;">
            <h2>Position Is Earned, Not Given</h2>
            <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
                We design for men who have already taken their position in life but continue to improve. 
                Quiet confidence. No visible logos. Recognition through cut, fabric, details.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
                The man who wears POSITION doesn't need to tell you who he is. You can tell by how he carries himself, 
                how his clothes move, how they age. He's not trying to impress — he simply is.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin: 80px 0;">
            <h2>Quiet Competence</h2>
            <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
                Luxury in the unseen: French seams that won't fray, mother-of-pearl buttons engraved with the POSITION mark, 
                silk lining with a unique pattern — details only the owner knows.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
                We believe that the best quality is the kind you don't notice. It doesn't shout. It supports. 
                It's the difference between a suit that looks good and a suit that makes you feel ready for anything.
